The aim of this site is to:
- introduce a meetup group
- advertise specific meetup events
- track RSVPs for events

## Running locally

You will need PHP and Composer installed. We support [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) for local development if you want to have the correct version of PHP and Composer installed.
