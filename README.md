# Perth Web meetup site

The aim of this site is to:
- introduce a meetup group
- advertise specific meetup events
- track RSVPs for events

## Running locally

You will need PHP and Composer installed. We support [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) for local development if you want to have the correct version of PHP and Composer installed.

To start developing:

    devbox services up

This will start a server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Laravel

This project uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com). You can read the Laravel project readme [here](./README-laravel.md).

It's my first time using Laravel. Feedback and advice welcome!
